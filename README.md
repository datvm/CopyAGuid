# Copy A Guid

An extremely simple Chrome extension that does a single thing: copy a newly generated GUID to your clipboard whenever you click it. Nothing else: no tracking added, no permission needed, no UI.

A single method for generating UUID taken from [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2117523/653457).
